Feedable
========

Generate an activity feed from several ActiveRecord models, without the need for extra activity tables!

I always find myself creating "activity" tables to log recently created objects (from multiple tables), so I can display them in a feed somewhere.  This gem removes the need for the extra table/hooks, so you can build rails apps even faster!

Requirements
------------

### Ruby and ActiveRecord

Requires Ruby version **>= 1.9.2** and ActiveRecord version **>= 3.0**


Installation
------------

Feedable should be installed as a gem in your app.  Currently, it is only available as the latest-build on github.  Fixed versions forth-coming.

For now, you have to live on the bleeding-edge:

    gem "feedable", :git => "https://github.com/cavis/feedable"
